## Welcome GitHub!
Yeap! I'm so happy that my blog is online successly. Even though it is so easy to do, I like it because of its beauty.
I gave him a name about programmer to record my knowledge, my thought and my mind. I knew I am not a good writer even more by english, but I will insist on writing. I hope I can see my  
growth in the future.
